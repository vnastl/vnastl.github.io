Hi!

I’m a PhD student at the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/), where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/) and [Nicolai Meinshausen](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~nicolai/).
I’m part of the Social Foundations of Computation Department at MPI for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in Tübingen, Germany, as well as the Seminar of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics at ETH Zürich.

My current research focus is on the responsible use of Machine Learning, encompassing the impact machine learning models have on research and society at large and steering this impact for good.
